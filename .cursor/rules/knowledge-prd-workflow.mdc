## PRD Workflow Knowledge Base

Use the markdown files under `cursor-ai-prd-workflow/` as persistent reference material for PRD/RFC-driven development.

- When creating or modifying PRDs, features, rules, RFCs, or implementation prompts, consult these docs first.
- Follow the exact structures, sequences, and constraints defined in these files.
- For implementation prompts, copy `cursor-ai-prd-workflow/implementation-prompt-template.md` and replace placeholders as instructed; do not alter other sections.

If there is ambiguity between instructions, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.
