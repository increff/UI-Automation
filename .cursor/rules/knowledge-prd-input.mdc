## PRD Input Knowledge

Treat `input/prd1.txt` as the canonical PRD for this project when present.

- Prefer this PRD for product requirements and acceptance criteria.
- Cross-reference with `cursor-ai-prd-workflow/**/*.md` for process and structure.
- If conflicts arise between ad-hoc instructions and the PRD, ask for clarification and propose a change via the PRD workflow prompts.
