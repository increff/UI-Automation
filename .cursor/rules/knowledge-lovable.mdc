## Lovable Design Guidelines

Treat the documents under `Lovable/` as authoritative UI/UX design guidelines for tone, UX patterns, and visual/system conventions.

- Consult these guidelines when making any UI, UX, copy, or interaction decisions.
- If guidelines conflict with acceptance criteria in the PRD (`input/prd1.txt`), follow the PRD and flag the discrepancy.
- Prefer consistency with Lovable patterns when choosing components, naming, and microcopy.
