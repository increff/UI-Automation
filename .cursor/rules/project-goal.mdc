## PRD Compression & UI Output Generation

Goal: Take the input PRD from `@knowledge-prd-input` and, using `@knowledge-prd-workflow.mdc`, create an improved PRD that uses less context space for LLM processing; then apply coding guidelines from `@knowledge-coding-guidelines.mdc` and design guidelines from `@knowledge-lovable.mdc` to generate three UI outputs.

### Steps
1. Load PRD from `@knowledge-prd-input`.
2. Apply the PRD Workflow Knowledge Base (`@knowledge-prd-workflow.mdc`) to compress and reorganise the PRD into a structured, lower-token format while preserving acceptance criteria and traceability.
3. Produce an Improved PRD artifact (store under `.taskmaster/docs/` or `requirements/<timestamp-slug>/`), including:
   - Executive summary and scope boundaries
   - Normalised requirements with acceptance criteria
   - Open questions and assumptions
4. Use `@knowledge-coding-guidelines.mdc` and `@knowledge-lovable.mdc` to generate the following three UI outputs phases:
   - UI Output phase 1: Component and state catalogue (all screens, states, and interactions) aligned to Lovable patterns.
   - UI Output phase 2: Implementation scaffolds (component/file skeletons) conforming to coding guidelines.
   - UI Output phase 3: Preview harness (e.g., Storybook stories or equivalent) to review states and interactions.

### Completion Criteria
- Improved PRD is generated and demonstrably smaller in token footprint while retaining fidelity to `input/prd1.txt`.
- Three UI outputs are created and reference the Improved PRD, coding guidelines, and design guidelines.
- All artifacts are versioned and traceable to the original PRD and the questionnaire outputs.

This goal applies to the entire workspace so that all agents understand the overarching objective and can coordinate accordingly.
